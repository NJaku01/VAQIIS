<p style="text-align: justify">This repository provides all technical resources needed to set up the mobile and stationary client, which was developed by the Supporting-Bike-Mission group during the winter semester 2019-20. The goal of this study project was to support researchers in landscape ecology who collect air data using a load bike with sensors. For this purpose the already existing load bike was extended by wireless functionalities and visualization possibilities.</p>

In addition to this repository, the repository [VAQIIS_WebServer](https://github.com/Thiemann96/VAQIIS_WebServer) contains resources that should be used to set up the pi web server as well as scripts that can be used to automate common tasks while using both clients.
